\# Insertion Sort in R



!\[Publication Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/published-2019-blue)  

\*(Created before AI coding assistants became widely available)\*



\## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the \*\*Insertion Sort\*\* algorithm written in \*\*R\*\*.  

It was created as part of a programming exercise to demonstrate understanding of basic sorting algorithms and R programming fundamentals.



\## Historical Context

This project was originally published \*\*before the widespread availability of AI coding assistants\*\*.  

At the time, there were no AI tools that could prepare this task for me — I developed it \*\*entirely on my own\*\*.  

The code reflects my personal programming skills at that point in time, regardless of their level, and serves as an authentic record of my learning journey.



\## How It Works

Insertion Sort is a simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm.  

It works by building a sorted portion of the list one element at a time, inserting each new element into its correct position.



\*\*Algorithm steps:\*\*

1\. Start from the second element in the list.

2\. Compare it with the elements before it.

3\. Shift larger elements one position to the right.

4\. Insert the current element into the correct position.

5\. Repeat until the list is sorted.



\## File Structure

\- \*\*`insertion-sort.R`\*\* – The R script containing the implementation of the algorithm.



\## Usage

1\. Clone the repository:

&nbsp;  ```bash

&nbsp;  git clone https://github.com/GP-data-engineer/insertion-sort.R.git
